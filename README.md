Generate a hand from a 'thing from the future'-like game

Thing From The Future is described here: http://situationlab.org/projects/the-thing-from-the-future/

It's a card game for generating prompts for plausible future objects -- kind of like a cross between Cards Against Humanity and the tarot.

Because generating random configurations of constraints is a very powerful way of stimulating creativity, games like this are very valuable.

Unfortunately, the decks cost $40, and Situation Lab doesn't seem to provide scans of them. This limits circulation.

So, I'm using the format from the game (omitting the gameplay -- I assume a single user rather than a group -- and omitting the actual cards because I don't have access to them) and generating prompts similar in form to those generated by it.
